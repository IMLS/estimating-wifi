<!--

User stories follow this format:

As  __(role/persona)__,
so that __(goal to accomplish)__,
I would like __request__.

The user story should have a reason to exist: what do I need as the user
described in the summary?  This part details any detail that could not be
passed by the summary.

Note: user stories speak to the What, not the How; they describe the
request, not the solution.  Use the Notes section or add comments to
provide suggestions.
