# Automating WIFISESS

Our first pilot involves using low-cost, open tools to automate the monitoring of wifi usage. 

## Our ask: 9 libraries

We're asking for **9 partner libraries** to help us pilot the hardware and software involved.  we want you to know that this is a **data collection experiment**, and not a test of your technical abilities. We'll be on call to help you anywhere you might get stuck.

## What we'll do

If you volunteer to help out, we will mail you:

1. A Raspberry Pi kit.
2. A USB wifi adapter.
3. An ethernet cable.

(The following images are meant to be representative only.)

  <div class="grid-row">
    <div class="tablet:grid-col">
    <h3>A Raspberry Pi kit</h3>
    {% asset pi-kit.jpg %}
    </div>
    <div class="tablet:grid-col">
    <h3>A USB wifi adapter</h3>
    {% asset pau06.jpg %}
    </div>
    <div class="tablet:grid-col">
    <h3>A short ethernet cable</h3>
    {% asset ether.jpg %}
    </div>
  </div>
</div>


## What you'll do

You'll follow some setup instructions that involve:

1. Downloading a file
2. Putting that file on a microSD card
3. Putting the card in the Pi
4. Plugging a keyboard and mouse (not included) into the Pi
5. Plugging the Pi into an HDMI monitor (monitor not included)
6. Creating an account on [api.data.gov](https://api.data.gov/)
7. Saving your api.data.gov account info on the Raspberry Pi
8. Plug it in, and you're done!

This will, we believe, take roughly an hour. (More thorough documentation is underway.)

## What we're hoping

We have a three hopes.

1. **Hope:** We're hoping for a mix of big and small libraries, rural and urban. <br>
    **Why?** Because we think we'll see different data and different challenges in each case. 
2. **Hope:** We're hoping for librarians with a diverse backgrounds with respect to tech. <br>
    **Why?** Because we want processes and technologies that are useful and usable to many libraries and librarians.
3. **Hope:** That you're interested in helping understand how libraries are used today. <br>
    **Why?** Because the point of the pilot is to improve *what* and *how* we collect data for the PLS.

## We'll probably want to chat when this is over

If you're willing to chat with the 18F team (Matt & James) when we're done, we would appreciate it greatly. 


# Questions you might have

We can imagine a question or two you might have. If more questions are asked, we'll update this list. 

## Will I be compensated?

No. The GSA has some policy on that, and sadly, we can't. We don't think that's right, but we don't have scissors big enough to cut that particular bit of red tape.

## Will the results of this work be open?

Yes. The code, data, and process by which we engage in this work will all be public domain/freely licensed. 

## Who are you again?

We're a team of engineers at 18F (Matt Jadud and James Tranovich), a small digital services unit in the GSA. We work to make government more open and people-centered.
