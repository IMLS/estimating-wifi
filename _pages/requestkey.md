You will need this key, and ask us to activate it, as part of the setup process. 

**You must do this in order to set up you RPi**! Requesting a key takes a few minutes. Asking for us to activate it is similarly quick. However, "activating" your key involves a manual step on the part of 18F engineers (this is a data pilot, after all... not everything is automated), so that means you should do this well in advance of setting up your RPi. If you put this off until the last minute, you'll end up waiting on us.

What is api.data.gov? It is a service that helps protect interactive, web-based systems used by the federal government. Many agencies use it as a way to make their data publicly available (e.g. the Department of Education, DOJ, NASA, NIH, and many others). We are using it to secure the data that your RPi will be collecting as well as provide a gateway for the data to be extracted later. Signing up for this is quick, it is intended for use by the public, and no, you will not get SPAM as a result of signing up for an API key.

Visit the [api.data.gov signup page](https://api.data.gov/signup/). (Please use an official email address for this step. "Official" means "your work email," not a personal email address.)

You will be asked for your first and last name, your email address, and an optional reason. You could put "IMLS/10x/18F data pilot", if you like.

api.data.gov will email you a key. After you get your key (watch your SPAM folder, just in case), [use our interest form]({{site.questionformurl}}) to let us know that you have received your key. 

DO NOT SEND US YOUR KEY. KEEP IT SECRET. KEEP IT SAFE.

We can look you up by email, "activate" your key, and make sure things will work when you get to the point that you need your API key. It comes up later in the setup.
