# Data at import

For local development, we have multiple data files.

`test-data.sql.gz` contains *real* data that is anonymized. It is pulled from the Phase 3 data collection, and then updated to match the current data schema.

`imls-data-2020.csv` is data from the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS). Specifically, we are using outlet data from 2020. It is public domain data, and we sourced it from https://www.imls.gov/research-evaluation/data-collection/public-libraries-survey.
