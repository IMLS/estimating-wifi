# Windows Installer

## Automated Build Process

This process assumes a user is using a Windows machine and has admin rights.

### Download the installer

Visit https://github.com/IMLS/estimating-wifi/actions/runs/3100996980 and click on the SessionCounterInstall artifact.

Navigate to your Downloads folder, and extract the .zip file.

### Run the Installer
- Right click on SessionCounterInstall.exe and click "Run as Administrator"
- Follow the instructions to install Wireshark 
- For npcap, check all three options
	- Restrict Npcap driver's access to Administrator only
	- Support raw 802.11 traffic (and monitor mode) for wireless adapters
	- Install Npcap in WinPcap API-compatible mode

### Check to Ensure Session-Counter is Running
- Ctrl + Alt + Delete to open the Task Manager
- Scroll to the Background Processes section
- If `Windows Service Wrapper` is running the `estimating-wifi` program, then it's running in the background as expected

### Update session-counter.ini

While the service is running in the background, you may need to update session-counter.ini with new config values.
- Open your Windows start menu and search for Notepad
- Right click the Notepad app and click 'Run as administrator'
- Click 'File' > 'Open' and navigate to 'C:\Program Files (x86)\IMLS Session Counter\service\session-counter.ini'
- Update `session-counter.ini` with your desired variable(s), then save the file
- Open Powershell as an admin and cd to C:\Program Files (x86)\IMLS Session Counter\service
- Run `./WinSw-x64.exe restart estimating-wifi`
- Run `./WinSw-x64.exe status estimating-wifi` (just to confirm it's running)
- You can check `WinSw-x64.err.log` to see if your changes were made
