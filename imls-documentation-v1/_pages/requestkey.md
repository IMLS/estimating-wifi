Visit the [api.data.gov signup page](https://api.data.gov/signup/). (Please use an official email address for this step. "Official" means "your work email," not a personal email address.)

You will be asked for your first and last name, your email address, and an optional reason. You could put "IMLS/10x/18F data pilot", if you like.

**You must do this in order to set up you RPi**! Requesting a key takes a few minutes. Asking for us to activate it is similarly quick. 

After you get your key (watch your SPAM folder, just in case), [use our interest form]({{site.questionformurl}}) to let us know that you have received your key. We will activate the key as soon as we see the message come in. (But... we might not see it right away...)

*In case you want to learn a bit more, we've included a bit of background on this part*.
## What is this? 

What is an API? What is all this talk of keys?

### One explanation: a standard interface

One explanation we like is from 18F alumna Robin Carnahan. "APIs are standard interfaces." What is a "standard interface?" **You are surrounded by them.**

The electrical outlet is a standard interface. There are different physical interfaces for different uses; 240V power looks different in the US than 120V; three-phase power (used by things like a dryer or oven) looks different than the two-phase power everywhere else in the house. And, outlets look different in different countries, because line voltages differ from country-to-country. All of that said... it is an interface governed by standards.

(If you're thinking Dublin Core and metadata standards at this point, you're exactly correct.)

### Another explanation: a bit more contextual

In the context of this project, we might take this idea a bit further. We really like Danielle's explanations, in part because we like LEGO. But, also because her explanations are really clear.

So, that's an API. 

What is api.data.gov? It is a service that helps protect interactive, web-based systems used by the federal government. Many agencies use it as a way to make their data publicly available (e.g. the Department of Education, DOJ, NASA, NIH, and many others). We are using it to secure the data that your RPi will be collecting as well as provide a gateway for the data to be extracted later. Signing up for this is quick, it is intended for use by the public, and no, you will not get SPAM as a result of signing up for an API key.

api.data.gov will email you a key. 

**DO NOT SEND US YOUR KEY. KEEP IT SECRET. KEEP IT SAFE.**

After you receive your key, [use our interest form]({{site.questionformurl}}) to let us know that it arrived. Do not send us your key; just drop a note saying it arrived.
