These instructions are for setting up a Raspberry Pi for participation in the IMLS/18F/10x WIFISESS pilot. We recommend reading all of the instructions first, and then following them step-by-step.

If the setup fails in any way, please [reach out to the 18F team]({{site.questionformurl}}), and we'll connect with you to help complete the setup. **Remember: you can't hurt the Pi, and you can always start over if things go wrong**. The worst that can happen is that you have to do it again. (Trust us... we've gone through this process *dozens* of times.) 

We strongly recommend you [request an api.data.gov access key]({{ "/requestkey/" | prepend: site.baseurl }}) before you do anything else. It takes 2 minutes (really), but we have to push buttons in the background. So, go ahead and get that process started right away.

## The Instructions

We have been consolidating things. All of the [setup instructions for version two of the software can be found on the project wiki](https://github.com/18F/imls-pi-stack/wiki).

When you're done, you can [explore your data]({{"/explore/" | prepend: site.baseurl}}). Your sensor updates at midnight, so your sensor will need to be "on" and running overnight before you see data. (But, you can check out other libraries in the meantime!)
